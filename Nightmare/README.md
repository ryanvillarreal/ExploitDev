## Nightmare
https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/index.html

Nightmare is an intro to binary exploitation / reverse engineering course based around ctf challenges. I call it that because 
it's a lot of people's nightmare to get hit by weaponized 0 days, which these skills directly translate into doing that type 
of work (plus it's a really cool song).
